# Log-Parser

This is the code for paper "AS-Parser: Log Parsing Based on Adaptive Segmentation".

You can run it directly through "ASParser/benchmark/ASParser_benchmark.py", and get the Parsing Acurracy in all 16 datasets from Loghub (https://github.com/logpai/loghub).

Requirement: scipy-1.7.3, pandas-1.5.0 (These are the versions we actually use. It should also be possible to use other versions)
